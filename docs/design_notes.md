## Gear Designs

## Designing Drive Axle Sheath
- v1: 7.9mm outer diameter, 5.25mm inner diameter
- v2: 8.0mm outer diameter, 5.5mm inner diameter

## Motor Gear Design
- 110% motor shaft size is too large
- 105% motor shaft size is a bit too tight, but will do I think. Can shave down the inside a bit.
- 106-107% motor shaft size is probably ideal, but can work with 105%

## Servo Frame Designs
- `servo_frame` has the cutout of the SG-90 servo exactly (no buffer)
- `servo_frame_0.25mm` is where I pushed every "wall" that hugs the servo out 0.25mm (so combining both, 0.5mm of space).
