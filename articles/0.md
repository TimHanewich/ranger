For decades, scientists and engineers have been remotely controlling rovers on distant worlds like the moon, Mars, and even asteroids and comets. These machines have acted as surrogates for humanity, exploring uncharted areas of our solar system under our command. As a robotics enthusiast, I've always been fascinated by the capabilities of these off-planet rovers and wanted to replicate some of their functionality in a project of my own.

## Project Goals
After gaining experience with smaller projects, I felt ready to tackle a more ambitious challenge. I set out to build a long-distance rover with the following requirements:
- **Long Range**: I wanted to create a rover that could operate over vast distances, exceeding the limited range of traditional RC cars.
- **Long-Lasting Bidirectional Communication**: My rover needed to maintain a constant stream of communication in both directions, receiving instructions from an operator while transmitting telemetry data back.
- **Transmit Imagery**: The rover had to be able to transmit images back to the operator, allowing for real-time control and decision-making.
- **Battery Life**: With long-range operation in mind, I aimed for a battery life of at least 5-6 hours to support extended missions.

## Building Ranger
With these goals in mind, I set out to build my rover, which I named Ranger. In the following chapters, I'll delve into the details of designing, printing, assembling, wiring, and coding Ranger:

- Chapter 1: Hardware Design
- Chapter 2: Electrical Wiring
- Chapter 3: Communication Protocol
- Chapter 4: Capturing and Encoding Images
- Chapter 5: The Code
