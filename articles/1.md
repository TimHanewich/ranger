# How I Built Ranger, Chapter 1: Hardware Design

- Many of design aspects borrowed from PYPER
- CHallenge: Has to be bigger to fit more stuff. Only a 200x200 printer.
- Components used:
    - TT Motor @ 5V
    - SG-90 Servo
    - Logitech C270
- 3D design:
    - Steering system
        - Tye rode
        - Bearings within wheels
        - Thread locker to prevent nut from slipping
    - Drive system
        - TT Motor mount
        - Drive axle mating to shaft
        - 608 bearing holders
        - Inner diameter of 608 bearing is too wide for 5mm shaft, so small "adapter" I made
        - Shaft "shoe" ends in hexagonal shape and mounts a wheel.
    - Webcam platform
    - This will leave space on the body to put holes into where individual components can be screwed in securely.
